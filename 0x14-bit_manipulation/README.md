Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
this project deals with bit manipulation.                                                                                               

1. function converts binary to unsigned int                                                                                             

2. prints binary reprsentation of a number                                                                                              

3. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.                                                                   

4. sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.                                                                                       

5. function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.                                                                         

6. a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.                                 

7.  function that checks the endianness.                                                                                                

8. Find the password for this program.                                                                                                  

~                                                                                                                                       

~
